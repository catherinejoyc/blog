<h2>My work progress</h2>
<h3>Research</h3>
<p>I followed the html and css tutorials on <a href="https://www.w3schools.com/">w3 schools</a> to have a basic understanding of web development.</p>

<p>The first weeks I just played around with the layout/structure and styles of this website just to get comfortable with HTML and CSS.
I imitated the folder structure from <a href="https://html5up.net/hyperspace">this template</a> and took a look at its code structure.</p>

<h3>How it all started</h3>
<p>In fact, the Hyperspace template inspired me to design and create my own website without (using a template).
I had a lot of fun rewriting and restructuring the template to add my own twist to it -
and that is how I ended up searching for an old website that I made in my second year of HTL
(see <a href="https://www.bildungssystem.at/en/school-upper-secondary/college-for-higher-vocational-education">Higher Federal Technical College - Austrian Education System</a>).</p>

<p>Braced for embarrassment - I actually was a little impressed by 15-year-old me. After that I decided to skill up and start with web-development.</p>
